        <h3>Preexisting Research</h3>
        <p>
          There have been previous attempts at predicting thoroughput via
          machine learning. One study,
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/11/1/78"
            >Prediction of Hourly Airport Operational Throughput with a
            Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network</a
          >, utilized convective weather information from the NOAA and flight
          trajectory data to train a multi-branch convolutional neural network
          (MB-ResNet) to predict flight arrivals at KATL. This paper explicitly
          mentions the importance of their weather tensor, convection
          indicators, traffic flow data, and nominal path indicators, leading us
          to believe that these features are likely to be relevant in our
          approach as well. With a RMSE of 0.11 in predicting arrivals and
          departures, this model demonstrates strong performance.

        <h3>Model</h3>
        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <p>
          The data we were provided is in a time series format. In order to
          account for the dimension of time, we utilized a recurrent neural
          network. RNNs capture time steps in hidden layers, which is critical
          when trying to analyze how data evolves w.r.t. temporal conditions. In
          our case, we are dealing with both short and long term time
          dependencies, where we need to not just capture micro changes per hour
          but also macro changes like meteorological differences per season. For
          this, we built an LSTM to capture these long term dependencies
          specifically.

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          mention model acting as baseline and only giving averages prior to
          making time cyclic
        </p>
        <p>mention joining all data together</p>

        <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
        <p>mention manual tuning first</p>
