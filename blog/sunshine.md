# super mario sunshine & the seto inland sea

In 2006, a weird kid with a poor attention span and a natural inclination towards high-contrast, HDR-ed to shit visuals would discover the Nintendo Gamecube. Super Mario Sunshine is, without a doubt, the greatest game to ever exist in my universe. There's something about creatures and animating inanimate objects that just gets me. Portal has GLaDOS, Super Mario Sunshine has Shine Sprites and Piantas and the Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device (F.L.U.D.D.).

Nintendo's storytelling capabilities aside, the gameplay is amazing and especially for its time, the designers did a really good job. There were large amounts of water, and water is notoriously difficult to portray in any visual medium. Just ask the Pixar folks who worked on The Good Dinosaur and [used over 17 terabytes for animating one water sequence](https://www.slashfilm.com/540349/making-of-the-good-dinosaur/) - that's bigger than the entirety of Cars 2 - or any of the numerous researchers and artists tasked with [making the water in Finding Nemo](https://www.awn.com/animationworld/finding-right-cg-water-and-fish-nemo).

The Super Mario Sunshine team was limited to a fixed-function CPU in 2001 and really creatively designed their water effects to work within their constraints. They succeeded so well that their water designs were used in Nintendo game design [for over a decade afterwards](https://blog.mecheye.net/2018/03/deconstructing-the-water-effect-in-super-mario-sunshine/).

When I planned my bike trip to Japan, I was not thinking about Super Mario Sunshine at all, or at least not any more than I usually do. When I reached the Seto Inland Sea, crossing between the Hiroshima and Ehime prefectures, the docks that came into sight as I biked through small coastal towns looked exactly like Ricco Harbor.
