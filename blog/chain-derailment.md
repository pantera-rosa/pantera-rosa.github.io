# chain derailment

A 1x10 drivetrain is supposed to be sufficient for a moderate biker. My current bike, a Cannondale Topstone 3 I named Inspector Clouseau, is the unfortunate corpus to a microSHIFT Sword gravel groupset with a 1x10 drivetrain. I really loved it for the first 300-400 miles I rode it, which makes sense given my past bike experience was on the 3-speed (if I was lucky), 40 pound classic bicycles of Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare program. Anything feels lightweight and efficient compared to those beasts.

However, the reality of my setup caught up to me on a recent route, the Biwaichi. I chose this route because it is relatively flat with the exception of a few short distance 7-8% grades. There aren't really 7-8% grades on my go-to routes in the D.C. metro area, and my bike is just not set up for it. I don't know if it was the 1x10 drivetrain or the cheaply made microSHIFT components, but I found the hills to be awful and I hated having to hop off my bike and re-chain manually when the chain derailed on the steeper inclines.
