My current bike, a Cannondale Topstone 3 I named Inspector Clouseau, is the unfortunate corpus to a microSHIFT Sword gravel groupset with a 1x10 drivetrain. I really loved it for the first 300-400 miles I rode it, which makes sense given my past bike experience was on the 3-speed, 40 pound classic bicycles of Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare program."
