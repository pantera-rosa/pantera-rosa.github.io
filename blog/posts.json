      "content": "A 1x10 drivetrain is supposed to be sufficient for a moderate biker. My current bike, a Cannondale Topstone 3 I named Inspector Clouseau, is the unfortunate corpus to a microSHIFT Sword gravel groupset with a 1x10 drivetrain. I really loved it for the first 300-400 miles I rode it, which makes sense given my past bike experience was on the 3-speed, 40 pound classic bicycles of Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare program. Anything feels lightweight and efficient compared to those beasts. However, the reality of my setup caught up to me when I was riding the Biwa-ichi loop. I chose this route as part of my Japan bike trip because it is relatively flat with the exception of a few short distance 7-8% grades. There aren't really 7-8% grades in the D.C. metro area - I can't think of any on my go-to routes at least - and my bike is just not set up for it. I don't know if it was the 1x10 drivetrain or the cheaply made microSHIFT components, but I found the hills to be awful and I hated having to hop off my bike and re-chain manually when the chain derailed on the steeper inclines."
