      <h1>Data Overview</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The data provided through this competition consists of two main
          categories: flight information and weather information, distributed
          throughout 200GB of 4 different data sources (FUSER, METAR, TAF, and
          CWAM). There are certain features that stood out to us given their
          known relevance to flight maneuvers:
        </p>
        <h4>Wind Speed, Wind Gusts, and Wind Direction</h4>
        <p>
          Aircraft take off and land into the wind whenever possible for better
          lift and control. Headwinds slow down the aircraft, increasing fuel
          consumption and extending flight times. Tailwinds shorten flight times
          and save fuel. Sudden, strong changes in wind speed (called wind
          gusts) can cause turbulence during takeoff, landing, and even
          mid-flight. They may require pilots to adjust flight paths or speeds.
          Changes in wind direction may force air traffic controllers to switch
          active runways, causing delays. High wind gusts can complicate landing
          approaches, especially in crosswind conditions. Airports have specific
          crosswind limits for safe operations, and gusts exceeding these limits
          may result in diversions or delays.
        </p>
        <h4>Precipitation and Thunderstorms</h4>
        <p>
          Thunderstorms are hazardous due to turbulence, lightning, hail, and
          strong updrafts or downdrafts. Flights may need to reroute around
          storm systems, causing delays. Airports might temporarily close during
          severe thunderstorms due to lightning risks for ground crews.
        </p>
        <h4>Cloud Cover</h4>
        <p>
          Low cloud cover reduces visibility during takeoff and landing,
          requiring Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) and additional pilot
          training. Dense cloud cover can complicate approaches and departures,
          potentially leading to delays or diversions to airports with better
          visibility.
        </p>
        <h4>Airport Code</h4>
        <p>
          An airport's location (i.e. KJFK -> K for the United States, JFK for
          John F Kennedy in New York City) is likely to be correlated with some
          changes in flight time, either due to the weather surrounding the
          aiport, the personnel maintaining the airport, or a number of other
          factors.
