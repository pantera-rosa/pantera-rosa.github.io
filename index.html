      <h1>FlightHunters</h1>
      <h2>The NASA Airport Thoroughput Prediction Challenge</h2>
      <h5>Ilona Bodnar, Carol Sanchez Garibay, Fan Lin</h5>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        During peak periods, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) monitors
        and directs over 5,000 flights simultaneously. Every day, FAA's Air
        Traffic Organization (ATO) provides service to more than 45,000 flights
        and 2.9 million airline passengers across more than 29 million square
        miles of airspace. With over 10,000,000 scheduled passenger flights
        yearly, it is crucial that we understand all the factors that impact
        flight time and flight arrivals.
      </p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        This challenge aims to develop a regression model capable of accurately
        forecasting the number of flight arrivals (throughput) at U.S. airports
        within a short-term timeframe. Specifically, the task is to predict,
        given an airport ABC and a timestamp TT, the expected number of arriving
        flights within the next three hours, segmented into 15-minute intervals.

      </div>
      <p>
        Accurate throughput predictions are essential for optimizing the
        utilization of airport resources, runways, and the broader National
        Airspace System (NAS). This enables air traffic management systems to
        better handle the constraints imposed by limited capacity, especially
        during periods of high demand or adverse weather conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Preexisting Research</h3>
      <p>
        Previous research has explored the use of machine learning to predict
        airport throughput. One notable study,
        <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/11/1/78"
          >Prediction of Hourly Airport Operational Throughput with a
          Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network</a
        >, utilized convective weather data from the NOAA alongside flight
        trajectory information to train a multi-branch convolutional neural
        network (MB-ResNet) for forecasting flight arrivals at
        Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL). The study
        emphasized the importance of incorporating weather tensors, convection
        indicators, traffic flow data, and nominal path predictors as critical
        features. These findings suggest that such factors are likely to play a
        significant role in improving the performance of throughput prediction
        models, providing a strong foundation for further exploration in this
        domain.
