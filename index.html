        <h2>The NASA Airport Thoroughput Prediction Challenge</h2>
        <h5>Ilona Bodnar, Carol Sanchez Garibay, Fan Lin</h5>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>During peak times, the FAA is monitoring and directing over 5,000 flights at any given minute. Every day, FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) provides service to more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers across more than 29 million square miles of airspace. With over 10,000,000 scheduled passenger flights yearly, it is crucial that we understand all the factors that impact flight time and flight arrivals. 
        </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>The objective of this challenge is to develop a regression model that can accurately forecast with greater accuracy the number of arrivals (throughput) of US airports into the near future using existing estimated arrivals and weather forecast information.

            More formally, given an airport ABC, and a timestamp T, what is the expected number of arriving flights (throughput) in the next 3 hours with a resolution of 15-minutes time buckets. Accurate estimates of thoroughput can help air traffic management systems more efficiently use the limited capacity of airports, runways and the National Airspace System.</p>
