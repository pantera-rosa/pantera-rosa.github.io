      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Technical Policy Advisor & Professional Staff Member on the
        Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the
        United States Congress. In a past life, I built software at NerdWallet,
        Google, and a few startups. I have a Master's degree in Data Science
        from UC Berkeley and an interdisciplinary Bachelor's degree in
        technology and art from the University of Southern California.

        <br />
        <br />

        I am a data obsessive, I like bicycles, and to my mother's dismay, I
        dedicate about 7% of my daily caloric consumption to Dino Nuggets. I
        enjoy teaching and asking questions.
