      <h1>Convective Weather Avoidance Model (CWAM) Data</h1>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        CWAM (Convective Weather Avoidance Model) data provide forecast on the
        potential impact of convective weather. For each time of prediction, the
        data is a list of polygons at a specific altitude within which there is
        a percentage of chance greater than 60, 70, 80% to be impacted by
        convective weather. Polygons are represented by a list of their vertices
        in latitude, longitude (degrees). Forecasts are produced in general
        every 15 minutes and each forecast is made up to 2 hours in the future
        with a 5-minute interval. CWAM data are stored as compressed HDF5 files
        (.h5) with BZIP2 compression (.bz2).
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of data is extremely important to our model's predictions.
        Convection produces conditions that impact flight conditions -
        lightning, heavy rain, icing, hail, and turbulence - and is the number 1
        reason for delays in the U.S. National Airspace System.

      <h3>Findings</h3>

        <p>
          As expected, convective activity is more frequent at flight level 250,
          which is approximately 25,000 feet. Convection requires both moisture
          and instability, and both of these characteristics are more common at
          lower altitudes, since dryness and coldness increases and altitude
          increases. This is also where you are most likely to experience
          turbulence.

        <p>
          In the figure above, you can actually see the convective weather
          activity per hour, and note how much more frequent convective weather
          activity becomes in the evenings. This is a known phenomena with
          events like thunderstorms.

        <p>
          In this visual, a high concentration of activity is evident near
          Florida. Florida, with its hot, humid weather, peninsular shape, solar
          heating, jet stream influence, and general instability, is a prime
          spot for convective weather activity, and the data visualization
          aligns with what is expected.
