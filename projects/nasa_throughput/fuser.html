      <h1>FUSER Data</h1>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        The FUSER dataset consists of 8 types of CSV files, each providing
        various flight and airport-related data. The scheduled arrival
        throughput (TBFM) is based on the scheduled times of arrivals, while the
        estimated arrival throughput (TFM) is derived from real-time updates to
        estimated arrival times. Another important feature is the estimated
        departure throughput (ETD), as a high number of departures can indicate
        a higher number of arrivals in the future. Additional features include
        counts for aircraft type, carrier, and engine class (MFS), which are
        related to factors such as resilience to adverse weather and the time
        required for takeoff. The runway-to-gate time (CONFIG) provides insights
        into the level of ground traffic activity, and the local weather
        forecast (LAMP), with a one-hour resolution, includes nine weather
        conditions, such as wind and precipitation, that could impact
        operations. For more information on how FUSER data is generated and
        aggregated, visit <a href="https://github.com/nasa/atd2-fuser">here</a>.
